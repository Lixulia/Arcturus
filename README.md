*File directory for Arcturus, a SlimeVR case. (winterx renamed and completely redone)*

Hi! Here youll find the files for printing the arcturus case, and its extension case. These are the sucessors to the winterx and xtension cases.

This case is for the following compentents : 
- 804040 Battery (or smaller)
- BMI160
- Wemos D1 Mini
- tp4056 type C
- 26AWG wire (or smaller. Nothing bigger.)
- Aliexpress Power Switch (DPDT 2P2T)
- 2in elastic straps (Main case) or 1.5, it works too.
- 1in elastic straps (extensions)

You can download both the case and extension files in one zip in the releases.

*Recently I moved things into folders for cleanliness*

Dovetail version is now main case.

Just added alt lid versions, with body locations engraved into them.

**For lids**:
- LA or RA = Left or right arm.
- LL or RL = Left or right leg.
- LF or RF = Left or right ankle, or foot. *This is due to the shorthand A being taken by arm already.*
- HIP or CH = Hip or chest.
